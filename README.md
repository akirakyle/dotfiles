# dotfiles
My messy dotfiles. Feel free to use any part of them you like!

I was in the process of migrating my init.el over to use pacakge when I tried out spacemacs and I haven't looked back since, but I'm preserving my pre-use-package init.el and my half-migrated-to-use-pacage init.el for posterity.

I now have all my dotfiles in one single dotfiles.org file and use emacs org mode tangeling to export them so checkout dotfiles.org for my more organized current dotfiles
